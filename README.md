## Abstract
<p>For the people with hearing or speech impairments, it is very difficult to communicate with others who aren’t familiar with the sign languages. Speech and hearing-impairedpeople form a significant part of the society. Also, they can  be  your  loved  ones,  friends,  family  or  colleagues. People who aren’t familiar with the sign languages cannot understand what the other person using sign  language wants  to  convey.This  leads  to  a  large  communication  gapbetween  two  equally  important  communities  of  the  society.  This  very communication gap then leads to various inequalities and lack of opportunities for such specially-abled people. </p>
<p>To  reduce  this  communication  gap  &  in  turn  the  inequality,  we  have tried to come up with a solution.Our solution proposal for this issue is to create a  platform for  users  which  could  interpret  and  translate  the  sign  language gestures for them. So that the communication gap between community which isn’t aware of the sign languages and community which uses sign languages can be bridged.</p>

## Motivation

<p>The  United  Nations’ Department  of  Economic  and  Social  Affairs-Disabilityhas launched a campaign known as ‘Envision2030’.The tagline of Envision 2030 itself is ‘17 goals to transform the world for persons  with  disabilities’. In September  2015,  the  General  Assembly adopted  the  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development  that  includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Building on the principle of “leaving no one behind”, thenew  Agendaemphasizes  a  holistic approach to achievesustainable development for all.</p>
